Maximal oxygen consumption in relation to subordinate traits in lines of house mice selectively bred for high voluntary wheel running. _Journal of Applied Physiology_, _101_(2), 477â€“485.

In this paper, they used [rats] to study the relationship between [oxygen consumption] during forced exercise and different traits that are affected by oxygen transport and [cellular respiration]. They used 4 different lines of mice that were bred specifically for high voluntary [wheel running]. They were testing the hypothesis that the variation in oxygen consumption had to do with the amount of [hemoglobin] necessary to obtain certain amounts of oxygen, as well as the amount of [citrate synthase activity] and [myoglobin concentration].
